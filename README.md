# Shel Soloa Portfolio Website

Hosted at [shelsoloa.com](http://shelsoloa.com)

This repository is for the portfolio website of Shel Soloa

Made from scratch using Gatsby.js and StackOverflow, this website was initially developed over two weeks. I try to regularly maintain it, when life doesn't get too hectic.
