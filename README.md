# ShelSoloa Portfolio
### _This project is still a work in progress._

This is the repo for the portfolio website of Sheldon Soloa

Made over a few weeks using Gatsby.js, SASS, and StackOverflow.

Expected completion date: March 31, 2019.

You can find the development report hosted on the website at shelsoloa.com/blog/the-great-gatsby-portfolio-log

You can also watch a video related to creating this site and my experiences with gatsby at youtube.com/shelsoloa/gatsby

Resource and tools used:

1. Gatsby.JS - This was my first project working with Gatsby, and it actually made developing in javascript... bearable. Definitely a recommendation for anyone creating static websites. I'll absolutely be using this tool again in the future.
    
2. Hexes - This is a library I developed while creating this project. It allows you to create an interactive hexagon background. You can change the spacing between the hexagons, their color, and their highlight. Check out the repo for it over at github.com/shelsoloa/hexes

3. Arne16 Palette - The majority of the development time for this project was spent tweaking the CSS and after getting the layout working I didnt feel like fucking with the colors so I decided to use one of my faourite palattes created by Arne Arenson. Check it out over at androidarts.com/arne16palette

4. coolors.co - Another tool I use to find palettes. I ended up getting a few extra palettes outside of Arne for tweaking colors here and there. Very useful.

5. Sublime Text 3 - Best editor
