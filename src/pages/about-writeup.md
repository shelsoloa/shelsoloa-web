Yo! First off, thanks for checking out this portfolio/journal hybrid. It means A LOT to me that someone has taken the time to check out my corner of the internet! Very appreciated.

## What is this?

This website is part portfolio, part journal. Here I feature my projects, share highlights, announce updates, and (eventually) collect all the content that I produce.

### Who am I?

I'm Shel Soloa, a developer from Toronto, Canada. I've been programming for about 10 years, and (contrary to what my occasional departure from the medium suggests) it's my favourite and primary skill.

I create games, websites, tools, or whatever else. My main desire is to create, primarily through code but also occasionally through writing, art, videos, audio, etc. 

### What else do I like?

- English Staffordshire Terriers
- minimalism
- self-mastery
- making lists
- music culture
- internet culture

I'm interested in finding places where these interests intersect with my craft and creating content there. I might write about some of these interests from time to time. I'm not sure. We'll see what I come up with.

# Where can I see more from you?

You can find me on most socials under @shelsoloa, here's a breakdown of where I post my content:

- [twitter (@shelsoloa)](twitter.com/_shellbot_) ~ I'm most active on twitter. Usually sharing thoughts pertaining to my current projects, development, and additional ramblings. I try not to be too spammy: I promise.

- [github (shelsoloa)](github.com/shelsoloa) ~ View all my open-source projects.

- [tumblr (shelsoloa)](sshellbot.tumblr.com) ~ I post my original content to tumblr. Consider this a content feed without all the noise.

- [medium (@shelsoloa)](medium.com/@shelsoloa) [coming soon] ~ I'll be sharing more of my writing and you'll find most of it on this site or on medium. Follow me if you're interested in hearing a programmer ramble about various development or culture related minutiae.

- instagram [coming soon]

- LinkedIn [coming soon]


# Can you Hire me?

Sure, I'm currently open for contracts. If you want to work together then shoot me a message on any of my socials or here: [shel@shelsoloa.com](mailto:shel@shelsoloa.com)
