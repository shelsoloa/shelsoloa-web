## Bio 👨🏾‍💻

I'm __Shel Soloa__, a developer from __Toronto, Canada__ 🍁. I've been programming for about 10 years and intend to continue doing so, at least for the foreseeable future.

I create [websites, games, and productivity tools](/projects). Lately my desire to create has broadened to include [writing and more personal content](/blog). 

I'm not certain what I'll make next, but I believe it will be a combination of some or all of these mediums.

## About this website 👨🏾‍🔧

This site is part portfolio, part journal; I feature my [projects](/projects) and share my [written content](/blog). 

This website is still in early stages so it's missing a lot of my work; eventually I will have documented __all__ of my content on these pages. In the meantime, I hope you get a kick of seeing what's currently here and [__follow along__](http://twitter.com/shelsoloa) if you want to see more!

__For the nerds__: I developed this site using __Gatsby.JS__, you can browse the [source for the project](http://github.com/shelsoloa/shelsoloa-web "Github repo for shelsoloa website"), or read an article I wrote on [creating my portfolio](/blog/creating-my-portfolio).
