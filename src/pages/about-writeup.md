## Bio 👨🏾‍💻

Hey, I'm __Sheldon Soloa__. I'm a Software Engineer from __Toronto, Canada__ 🍁 who's been building things for over a decade in various technical disciplines.

I used to make videogames, then websites, then I led projects for small companies, then larger companies. Now, I'm focused on grokking the startup world, growing as a person, and sharing what I learn along the way.

That's pretty much it.
