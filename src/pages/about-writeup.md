## About this website 👨🏾‍🔧

This website is still in early stages, it's missing a lot of my work. Eventually I will have documented __all__ of my content on these pages.

__For the nerds__: I developed this site using __Gatsby.JS__, you can browse the [source for the project](http://github.com/shelsoloa/shelsoloa-web "Github repo for shelsoloa website"), or read an article I wrote on [creating my portfolio](/blog/creating-my-portfolio).
