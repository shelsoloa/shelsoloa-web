# Hi!

Yo! First off, thanks for checking out this portfolio/journal hybrid. It means A LOT to me that someone has taken the time to check out my corner of the internet! Very appreciated, friendo.

## Thanks, but what is this?

This website is part portfolio, part journal. Here I feature my projects, share highlights, announce updates, and (eventually) collect all the content that I produce.

### Who are you? 

![Shel Soloa Headshot by LensQualityEyes](../data/img/img_self.jpg)

I'm Shel Soloa, a developer from Toronto, Canada. I've been programming for about 10 years, and (contrary to what my occasional departure from the medium suggests) it's my favourite and primary skill.

I create games, websites, tools, or whatever else. My main desire is to create, primarily through code but also occasionally through writing, art, videos, audio, etc. 

### What else do you like?

- English Staffordshire Terriers
- minimalism
- self-care
- making lists
- music culture
- internet culture

I'm interested in finding places where these interests intersect with my craft and creating content there. I might write about some of these interests from time to time. I'm not sure. We'll see what I come up with.

# Where can I see more of you?
