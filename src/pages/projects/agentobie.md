## Story
Agent Obie is a mercenary employed by Onyx, an undercover agency tasked with protecting the world against the highest level of threats. His most recent job is to infiltrate a heavily-fortified encampment that has been emitting signs of hostile activity. You join Obie as he seeks to find out what could be going on there, and who is behind it.

## Background on Agent Obie

![](../../data/img/img_agentobie__gameplay-2.gif)

Agent Obie has been in development for roughly two years. I return to Agent Obie as a hobby when I have time, which isn't often.

#### Tools Used

- Godot
- PyxelEdit
- GraphicsGale
- Tiled2D
- sfxr

Development of Agent Obie was originally done using my custom built engine [Peachy](/projects/peachy "Peachy Project Page"), but development time was slow so Agent Obie was migrated to Godot, a free and open source game engine.

Levels are built using Tiled2D, sprites are done in either PyxelEdit or GraphicsGale, sound effects are outsourced or thrown together in sfxr.
