## Background on GameDevInspo

I made GDI in 2014. Initially it was a tumblr blog to scrapbook images I found inspiring but after gaining followers I started to invest time into it. Now GDI is another one of my hobby projects. I usually add to the feed when I'm doing game development because that is when I'm browsing for inspiring content, but sometimes I add to the feed just for the fun of it.

#### Tools Used
Behind the scenes GDI is using a scraper to pull images across the web from my favorite artists and developers. This scraper is developed using python and various web-scraping utilities. This tool is currently closed-source but I hope to release it once I'm done with it.
