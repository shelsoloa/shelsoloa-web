> My portfolio website


A place for me to post about all my projects and technical musings.


## Background on shelsoloa.com

Made from scratch using Gatsby.js and StackOverflow, this website was initially developed over two weeks. I try to regularly maintain it, when life doesn't get too hectic.


## Tools used

- Gatsby.JS
- SASS
